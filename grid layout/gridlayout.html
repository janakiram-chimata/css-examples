                <div class="intro-text">
                    <p>CSS Grid provides a trivial solution to a complex problem: How to display full-bleed content mixed with center-aligned width-constrained content. This solution ellimiates the need for auto-margins and floats while allowing the developer to change the grid globally and see those changes apply to each element individually.</p>

                    <div class="thumbnail">
                        <h3 class="thumbnail-title">Grid is great</h3>
                        <p>CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout tool. It is great for laying out content in a grid, and for laying out content in two dimensions.</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <img src="images/tree.jpg" alt="A solitary tree in a field.">
                    <div class="thumbnail">
                        <h3 class="thumbnail-title">Flex is great too</h3>
                        <p>That said, Grid is not always the right option for layouts. If for example you need to lay out a series of identical boxes like those you see here, Flex may be a better option.</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>

                        <h3 class="thumbnail-title">Know what tool to use</h3>
                        <p>In some cases Grid and Flex are interchangeable. In other cases one is definitely better than the other. The choice usually comes down to whether you are laying out a list of items (Flex) or creating a more nuanced layout (Grid).</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <section class="more">
            <div class="more-content">
                <h2 class="content-title">Subgrid would be nice here</h2>
                <p>The solution provided here is limited by the lack of support for subgrids. If subgrids were available, the solution would be more refined. In lieu of subgrid, the solution applies a grid to each full-bleed section within the layout using a common class <code>.grid</code> and creates the full-bleed/centered effect that way.<p>

            <div class="twin">
                <h2 class="content-title">Grid lets you do unusual things</h2>
                <p>Creating this layout, where two items share the total available viewport width evenly alongside full-width and centered content, is suprisingly complex if you don't have CSS Grid available.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="twin">
                <h2 class="content-title">Grid requires a rethink</h2>
                <p>Seeing this layout you may still think it's better to just use old methods with auto-margins and max-widths. And you <em>can</em>, but looking at the CSS you'll see the Grid approach is both cleaner and easier to understand.</p>
